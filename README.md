# Outline
The `IPLabImageAccess` class was created in the scope of the EPFL course **Image Processing I** (<a href="https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=522">MICRO-511</a>). The class is written in JavaScript and is intended to be used in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) running the [IJavascript](http://n-riesco.github.io/ijavascript/) kernel. However, it can also be used in a native JavaScript environment. The aim of the `IPLabImageAccess` class is to facilitate the creation and modification of images in JavaScript in order to implement Image Processing algorithms at the pixel level. As such it provides an easy-to-use interface to multidimensional arrays which can represent graylevel or colour images, offering utility functions and pixel access, while taking care of boundary conditions.

## Contributors
The class was developed in the most part by:
* Kay Lächler (kay.lachler@epfl.ch, [TheUser0571](https://github.com/TheUser0571))

under the guidance, help, testing and feedback of:
* Alejandro Noguerón Aramburu (alejandro.nogueronaramburu@epfl.ch, [Alejandro-1996](https://github.com/Alejandro-1996))
* [Pol del Aguila Pla](https://poldap.github.io), (pol.delaguilapla@epfl.ch, [poldap](https://github.com/poldap))
* [Daniel Sage ](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/index.html), (daniel.sage@epfl.ch, [dasv74](https://github.com/dasv74))

It was supported by EPFLs [Center for Digital Education (CEDE)](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/cede/), and it belongs to the [Biomedical Imaging Group](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/).
