# Outline
The `IPLabImageAccess` class was created in the scope of the EPFL course **Image Processing I** (<a href="https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=522">MICRO-511</a>). The class is written in JavaScript and was inteded to be used in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) running an [IJavascript](http://n-riesco.github.io/ijavascript/) kernel. However, it could also be used in a native JavaScript environment. The aim of the `IPLabImageAccess` class is to facilitate the creation and modification of images in JavaScript in order to implement Image Processing algorithms on the pixel level. As such it provides an easy-to-use interface to multidimensional arrays which can represent graylevel or colour images, offering utility functions and pixel access, while taking care of boundary conditions.
